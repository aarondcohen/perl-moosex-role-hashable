=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module adds a single method to an object to convert it into a simple hash.
In some ways, this can be seen as the inverse function to I<new>, provided
nothing too crazy is going on suring initialization.

Example usage:

	package Foo;
	use Moose;
	use MooseX::Role::Hashable;

	has field1 => (is => 'rw');
	has field2 => (is => 'ro');
	has field3 => (is => 'bare');

	__PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

	package main;

	my $foo = Foo->new(field1 => 'val1', field2 => 'val2', field3 => 'val3');
	$foo->as_hash;
	# => {field1 => 'val1', field2 => 'val2', field3 => 'val3'}

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 as_hash

Transform the object into a hash of attribute-value pairs.  All attributes,
including those without a reader, are extracted.  If a value is a reference,
as_hash will perform a shallow copy.

=cut

sub as_hash {
	my $self = shift;
	return +{
		map { ($_->name => $_->get_value($self)) }
		$self->meta->get_all_attributes
	};
}
